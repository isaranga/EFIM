1. During algorithm 1, after step 5 (removing items that are not in secondary
because those items cannot be in any high-utility pattern), LU's of all items are
probably changed (can only change downwards). Then, some of them may be lower than
minutil, but they are not recalculated during the algorithm. Does it change anything
if they are recalculated before step 7 (calculation of SU) and forward steps?
Let's try to put steps 2-5 in a loop, having new unpromising items removed over and over
(and order of items reevaluated), until there aren't LU's lower than minutil.
It can be proved easily that items with "new" LU lower than minutil are unpromising and
can be removed from dataset, experiments will show if it helps performance.
